##### Agenda:
- Python (pip)

## Meetup
* Python
    Talk about pip! PIP is a package manager for Python packages, what you totally will need while developing with Python. For Windows installers Pip should be built-in and in others like Linux based machines its just behind few lines! Usually stuff gets messy easily when running different Python versions (eg. Python 2.7 / 3+) when Python versions has different pip and different pip versions. Highly recommended way to use Python pip and have a sandbox place to develop things, is to use virtual environments. We should cover virtual env in some class for sure! 

* Others
    Friday 19.4 was Easter holidays so FCC was canceled.
