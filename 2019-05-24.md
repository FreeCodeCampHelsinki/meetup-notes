## Meetup
* Flask
    Continued Flask stuff! Learned more about Flask routing, troubleshooting and what Flask is about overall. You can find all the lessons here: https://github.com/FreeCodeCampHelsinki/flaskLessons . Thanks Tiki!


* Monday Beer
    Monday beer was in Rotterdam Kamppi. We were 5 people there and talked about FCC and tech overall. Summer in FCC- Helsinki will be held on normally (at least for now). Second talk was about what should do next in the Meetup, what people want to achive. There was also talking in the Slack, and most common thing was to do _projects_ aka some real stuff. Also some topics would like to be more deeply investigated. Good topics to raise up and lets try get for everyone pleasant thing to learn! Always communicate in Slack if needed anything / or comment about. This is volunteer based action :)
