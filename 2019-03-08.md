##### Agenda:
- Python: Datatypes (Lists, Tuples, Dicts)
- Break
- SQL: Update, Delete, Select basics


## Meetup
* Python 
    Python class started with introduction about basic datatypes like: str(), int(), float(), bool(), list(), tuple(), set(), dict(), generator & class. Here is a basic good information about Python datatypes: https://realpython.com/python-data-types/ & https://py.checkio.org/blog/python-slices/. Some picks from the classes: myList.append, myList.sort, myList.reverse(). Lot of laugh about how to spell TUPLE :D We will see which one is correct! What is the right way for naming conventions? https://stackoverflow.com/questions/159720/what-is-the-naming-convention-in-python-for-variable-and-function-names
    Also one attendee had made Excel-addon with Python: https://www.xlwings.org/ check it out!


* SQL: Update, Delete, Select basics
    Tiki were talking about basic queries like Update, Delete and select. There is a plenty of a resources in internet and W3Schools would be good for starters: https://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_syntax.asp. Pressing "next" from bottom of the page, it will lead you for more SQL queries! Lot of talk about how hashing/encrypting works in SQL. How to delete whole table (DROP TABLE users) DON'T USE IT IF YOU DONT KNOW HOW TO USE IT! And talk about "like": https://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_like.asp
