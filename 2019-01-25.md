##### Agenda:
- Angular: Observatable, HTTPS-services 
- Project
- Other things

## Meetup
* We made a component observable: https://angular.io/guide/observables-in-angular (ng g c observable --spec false)
    Obs states:
    1) It completes successful
    2) Error
    3) Obs been done
    Any component, any service, need to be notified via obs!
    Here some usages of Obs: https://angular.io/guide/practical-observable-usage
    We made few exercies with observ. First getting info from info.txt and second with doClick with button. Changes can see from the angularLessons repo

* Tasks:
    Pekka: Error page
    Nav-routing: Umar, Ali
