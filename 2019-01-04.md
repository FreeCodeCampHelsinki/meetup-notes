## Meetup
Tiki made once again great presentation about Angular. We made through calculate exercise, played around with Directives and Services.
Also we will in future put the meetup stuff to repository, so people who did not attend can always clone a repository.
Some resources from internet (Maybe Tiki you should check that these are not bad :D)
