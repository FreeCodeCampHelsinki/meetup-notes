Talked about FCC-Time. Friday is maybe the best, but can try to put it other time also!

Off-topic:
- Lot of nuts and refreshments
- We were finding Olli outside the Microsoft (2nd door if you come from Metro! Take main exit from Metro, go outside and find Microsoft logo and walk towards it. After you find Tieto door, walk more futher and you will find Microsoft door (at evening time there is purple light on small bridge)
- Microsoft facilities were good and awesome!
