Tikis notes:

3 things were decided:
1) Hosting for the project site would be done through github and the "hosting"/testing/deployment of the could be done through netlify.com
2) The project site would be a conference/hackathon type site. Everyone would bring a few ideas for features of the site at our next meetup. (Supplemental to this might I suggest everyone think of a name for the site. Here are my 2: CodeHEL or HEL Coders. Actually anything with HEL just because it sounds cool... to me at least)
3) The next meetup would be on Perjantai, 23 Marraskuuta, 1700. Venue to be decided but we are looking for a place where we can meet for free. I will try on my side at Microsoft, but that would mean you all would have to take the Metro to Keilaniemi in Espoo.

It was also mentioned that I would prepare a short session on AJAX but I could do it during our next meetup or our following meetup if there is a scheduling clash.

Cheers,
Tiki
